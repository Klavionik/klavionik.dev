title: About me

Thanks for checking in! I'm Roman, 30 years old. I was born and spent most of my life 
in the city of Surgut, now I live in Moscow and dedicate a decent amount of my time to 
programming (mostly web development & stuff).

I don't have a CS degree, I'm self-taught. Sometimes it bothers me, but then I recall
what James Bennet, an author of Django framework once [said about that](https://t.ly/iz7o), 
and it soothes me.

I'm pretty enthusiastic about software development. It's both my occupation and my 
passion. In my spare time, I fiddle with tools and technologies, read blog 
posts 
or books, and do [side projects](/en/projects) or Open Source. There are always plenty 
of things to do. :)

Apart from work, I take interest in foreign languages (I speak fairly good English and 
German), music, and musical instruments (I play guitar and synth).
