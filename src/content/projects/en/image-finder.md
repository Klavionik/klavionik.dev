It was in winter when I had to find a full-size version of some photo somewhere on my 
hard drive using only a very small variant of it.

This is how this script (basically, a convenience wrapper around ImageHash) was born. 
It served its purpose, I found the photo in question. Then I decided to write a short doc 
and put it into a repository - just in case I'll need it again.
