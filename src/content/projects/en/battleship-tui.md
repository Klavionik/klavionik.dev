A little-known fact: I like making CLI and other kinds of terminal applications. For the last few years, I was keeping 
an eye on [Textual](https://textual.textualize.io/), waiting for the opportunity to make something exciting using it. 
Well, here it is, a multiplayer terminal remake of the classic Battleship game.

- Single and multiplayer modes
