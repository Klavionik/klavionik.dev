Everybody knows these URL shortening sites, which take a long ugly link and turn it 
into a beautiful short one, which is convenient to share. This project does exactly that, 
but it is invented here. :)

## Features

- Create short links
- Set expiration date for short links
- Protect short links with a password
- Use a custom link alias (or stick with a pregenerated one)
- Keep your short link history
- Monitor clicks statistics

## Tools

Backend: Django/Django REST Framework, Celery, PostgreSQL.  
Frontend: React, Mantine.
