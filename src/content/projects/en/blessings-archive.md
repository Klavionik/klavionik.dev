Lately, I’ve been spending quite a lot of time playing this simple fun game (purge the heretics!) with my friends. After 
some time we all agreed that one of the things that this game is missing is the comprehensive list of all weapon 
enhancements (called blessings) that you own (and don’t own too). Yes, you can see your weapon’s earned blessings, but 
only _earned_ and only _one weapon at a time_.

Only a couple of weeks of everyday suffering over the game’s source code written in Lua, reverse engineering 
data structures and relations, and doing tiresome UI coding work, and here it is, a pretty and useful custom screen.

## Features

- A custom screen that displays all weapon blessings
- Filter by weapon type, blessings tier and earned/missing state
- Toggleable by hotkey

## Tools

Lua, Warhammer 40k Darktide Mod Framework
