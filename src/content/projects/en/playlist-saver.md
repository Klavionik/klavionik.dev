A little project I did a while ago to back up my precious playlists. One may use it the 
same way or to perform some sort of analysis (like, how many Megadeth songs you've got 
among your playlists?).

Sadly, it won't receive an approval from Spotify due to the nature of the project. That means that you won't be able to 
log in unless I manually grant you access.

## Features
* Login via Spotify
* All playlists/only public ones
* View your playlist summary
* Download playlists content as CSV data

## Tools
Backend: FastAPI.  
Frontend: Jinja2, Bulma.
